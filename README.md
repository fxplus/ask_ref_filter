Implementation described here:

Now added javascript widget to the node edit form for roles with the appropriate permissions to be able to 'paint' the syntax highlighting over the node body edit field. Idea is for content editor to complete text first and then apply tooltips/colours after, so that the node>body field does not get too confusing.
